## Issue Clustering, Reporter Consent & Group Chat (New)

### Goals
Prevent duplicate issues inside 100m, aggregate reporters, request consent for participation in shared discussion, and auto-adjust priority based on collective interest.

### Data Model Changes
Issue schema additions:
- mergedInto: ObjectId reference to canonical issue (if this is a duplicate)
- duplicates: [ObjectId] listing merged duplicates on the canonical
- reporters: [{ user, consent, joinedAt }] (legacy array of ObjectIds migrated via scripts/migrateReporters.js)
- thumbnailImage: First image of the earliest report (or first available) used as issue thumbnail

### Creation & Merging Flow
1. New report saved.
2. System searches for existing canonical issue in same category within 100m (geoWithin); if none, fallback bounding-box + Haversine.
3. If match:
   - New report marked duplicate (mergedInto set).
   - Reporter added to canonical reporters with consent = null.
   - votes incremented (auto up-vote) if reporter not already a voter.
   - Priority recomputed.
   - Socket event issueConsentRequest emitted ONLY to that user (personal room joining via socket auth userId).
4. If no match: new issue remains canonical and its first image becomes thumbnail.

### Consent Workflow
Socket emits to user room: issueConsentRequest { issueId, thumbnail, message }.
Frontend prompts user. User calls POST /api/issues/:id/consent { accept: true|false }.
On update backend emits issueConsentUpdated to the user room.
Only reporters with consent === true (or the original creator or government users) may post messages in chat.

### Chat Changes
- Chat endpoints always resolve to canonical issue.
- Post message requires government role or consenting reporter.
- Messages stored under IssueChatMessage with canonical issue id.

### Listing & Detail Enhancements
Government & detail responses now include:
- reportersCount & consentingReportersCount
- duplicatesCount
- thumbnailImage

### Migration
Run: node scripts/migrateReporters.js to convert legacy reporters array into structured reporter objects.

### Socket Rooms
On connection client provides auth userId, server joins personal room (userId). Consent and targeted notifications emitted to this room.

### New Endpoints
POST /api/issues/:id/consent -> record reporter decision.
POST /api/issues/cluster/retroactive -> (government) retroactive dedupe scan.

### Future Ideas
- Auto-escalate priority tiers based on consentingReportersCount thresholds.
- Allow reporters to revoke consent.
- Provide public aggregate metrics without exposing identities.
